I am a second year graduate student with the College of Information and Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I finished my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2012 from Birla Institute of Technology Mesra, Ranchi. I am interested in natural language processing and deep learning research and their applications in the real world. Checkout my resume to know more about my work. 


I am a second year masters student with the College of Information and Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am a research student at the Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab at UMass, working with Professor Andrew McCallum on the OpenReview project, where I focus on experimenting with different techniques of learning the expertise of a researcher for the purpose of obtaining automated and high confidence peer-review matches. I also worked as an intern with the Reseacrh and Development team at Lexalytics, where I focused on obtaining meaningful clusters of phrases in order to group similar phrase segments together, based on their semantic similarity.

My prime areas of interest include machine learning, deep learning and their application to the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. I am also intrigued by the application of different supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to real world arenas like finance and medicine. I have successfully completed several machine learning projects that included aspects of research, programming, data visualization, database management and documentation. I have been the fortunate co-authors of several conference papers, two of which have also received the best paper award.
